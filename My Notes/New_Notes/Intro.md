# Devops

    - A process of improving application delivery by ensuring there is a proper automation with a code qulity (or) application qulity, ensuring there is a continuous monitoring and continous testing in a place.

# Cloud

    - The On-demand delivery of coumputing resources (such as Services, Storage, Software, Networking, Database) over the internet.
    - Instad of maping physical date centers, organizations can use cloud providers like Aws, Azure, Gcp to access these resorces as needed.

## Public cloud

    - Public cloud is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider makes resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and applications, available to the general public over the internet.
    - Public cloud providers include AWS, Azure, and (GCP).
    - A multi-tenant environment, where multiple customers share the same infrastructure and resources.
    - Cost-effective option, as customers only pay for the resources they use.
    - Highly scalable, as resources can be easily added or removed as needed.

## Private cloud

    - Private cloud is a cloud computing model in which a single organization owns and manages its own cloud infrastructure, either on-premises or off-premises.
